Installation:
- Will need two different conda environments for two different tools
- follow instructions to install bigfish (https://big-fish.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
    - in the bigfish environment
- Create a mamba environment for the rest of the analyses:
    mamba create -n images python=3.10
    mamba install -c conda-forge -c bioconda tifffile numpy pandas imageio scipy

Workflow:
- copy full stacks to nested directories (Date/Transript/Condition/stacks)
- adjust settings on full_smFISH_pipeline.py as necessary
- go through the pipeline, commenting in/out sections as necessary
- should have a .tsv at the end to load into R for analysis
